github tutorial GO


Hi, my name is Yeyoung Won.
I'm just starting this GitHub tutorial.
I'm a computer science - mathematics double major but a lot of the time in computer science I feel out of my league with real-life practical applications.
I hope that through using GitHub I can get a bit more hands-on practical experience and stop being scared of it.
Maybe I'll even start working on actual development projects? Who knows!
